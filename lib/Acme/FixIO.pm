=head1 NAME

Acme::FixIO - Workaround for Windows chcp 65001 UTF-8 output bug

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::FixIO;

    print chr(300) x 3, chr(301), "UVW\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the underlying problem:
The last octet is repeated when Perl outputs a UTF-8 encoded string in
cmd.exe, chcp 65001

Two StackOverflow articles with basically the same problem:
L<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23416075> and
L<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25585248>.

This is caused by a bug in Windows. When writing to a console set to code
page 65001, WriteFile() returns the number of characters written instead
of the number of bytes.

Workaround: Inject a binmode(STDOUT, ':unix:encoding(utf8):crlf') into the
perl program.
