Acme::FixIO - Workaround for Windows chcp 65001 UTF-8 output bug

SYNOPSIS

    use Acme::FixIO;

    print chr(300) x 3, chr(301), "UVW\n";

DESCRIPTION

    This is the underlying problem:
    The last octet is repeated when Perl outputs a UTF-8 encoded string in
    cmd.exe, chcp 65001

    Two StackOverflow articles with basically the same problem:

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23416075
    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25585248

    This is caused by a bug in Windows. When writing to a console set to code
    page 65001, WriteFile() returns the number of characters written instead
    of the number of bytes.

    Workaround:

    Inject a binmode(STDOUT, ':unix:encoding(utf8):crlf') into the perl program
